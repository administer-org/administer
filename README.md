## What is it?

Administer is a next-generation admin system for Roblox which features modularity, granular permissions, a community-powered App Marketplace, and more.


## Installation

### 1. Get the model
You can find it in the [Releases](https://github.com/administer-org/administer/releases/) section or [on Roblox.](https://create.roblox.com/store/asset/127698208806211/Administer)

### 2. Make sure the game can run Administer properly:
You **must** enable the following permissions in your game for Administer to function. Everything can be found in Game Security settings.
- Studio APIs (for saving data and initializing settings, admins, apps, etc)
- HTTP Requests (for communicating with app servers)

(Optionally, Image APIs for rendering some nice looking blur effects)

### 3. Move to the correct location
Move Administer to ServerScriptService. If you would like, this is where you can hardcode admins inside of the Core/Configuration module. Please do not change any settings in this module.

### 4. Configure admins and settings
Enter the game and you should be greeted with the onboarding wizard, where you can configure your new Administer installation. Have fun!

## Custom commands & apps
Please read [our documentation.](https://docs.admsoftware.org) You'll be able to find video and text tutorials on Administer APIs, basic concepts, and advanced modification of the system.

## Contributions

Contributions are more than welcome and will be reviewed within a couple business days. We use Rojo so it's an easy sync (given you have the proper setup). Please read the CONTRIBUTING file at the top of the README.

Feeling nice? Add a feature from [our development priorities.](https://trello.com/b/GA5Kc0vB/administer) Want to fix a bug? Just push the fix. 

If you're adding a new feature, you may want to open an issue before coding something. We may deny PRs if it does not contribute to the project in a way an app can't. If you want an app on the main app server please [reach out to us](https://administer.notpyx.me/to/discord).
