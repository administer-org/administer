## What is it?

Administer is an admin system which takes modularity to a level never seen before. You only keep what you need. Don't need announcements? Get rid of it.
We also have a modern and consistient admin panel which does everything you'll ever need.


## Installation

> [!CAUTION]
> Administer will NOT boot without access to studio APIs and HttpService! If any of the two are disabled, Administer will not boot. Do NOT report any bugs if you see errors related to API access denied.

Administer is ready to go out of the box. Just install it from the Creator Store and place the script in ServerScriptStorage.
After that, you'll instantly be ready to go and add apps to your heart's content. The game's owner account/group will automatically be added as an admin. You can configure additional admins in the Admins script or in the panel (recommended)

## Contributions

Contributions are more than welcome (i'm just one person!) and will be reviewed shortly. We use Rojo so it's an easy sync (given you have the proper setup).

Feeling nice? Add a feature from [our development priorities.](https://trello.com/b/GA5Kc0vB/administer) Want to fix a bug? Just push the fix. 

If you're adding a new feature, you may want to open an issue before coding something. We may deny PRs if it does not contribute to the project in a way an app can't. If you want an app on the main app server please [reach out to me](https://discord.com/users/449950252397494274).
