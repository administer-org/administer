## What is it?

Administer is a next-generation admin system for Roblox which features modularity, granular permissions, a community-powered App Marketplace, and more.


## Installation

### 1. Get the model
You can find it in the [Releases](https://github.com/administer-org/administer/releases/) section or [on Roblox.](https://create.roblox.com/store/asset/127698208806211/Administer)

### 2. Enable permissions
The following **must** be enabled for Administer:
- Loadstring (property under SSS)
- Studio APIs (game security)
- HTTP Requests (game security)
- Optionally, Image APIs (game sec)

### 3. Move to SSS
Move Administer to ServerScriptService. If you would like, this is where you can hardcode admins (see Loader/Core/Configuration). Do NOT make changes to settings in this module.

### 4. Configure admins and settings
Enter the game (by default, everybody has access to settings in Studio), go to the Configuration menu, and have fun! Administer is very customizable.



## Contributions

Contributions are more than welcome and will be reviewed shortly. We use Rojo so it's an easy sync (given you have the proper setup). Please read the CONTRIBUTING file at the top of the README.

Feeling nice? Add a feature from [our development priorities.](https://trello.com/b/GA5Kc0vB/administer) Want to fix a bug? Just push the fix. 

If you're adding a new feature, you may want to open an issue before coding something. We may deny PRs if it does not contribute to the project in a way an app can't. If you want an app on the main app server please [reach out to us](https://administer.notpyx.me/to/discord).
